# Flutterfy

A website that visualises a user's Spotify top tracks as butterflies. Written with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Why?

"Spotify" and "butterfly" sounded similar to me, so I thought a little website with their portmanteau as its name would be nice. I was also inspired by [Receiptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/), which visualises your Spotify top tracks as a receipt, and generally interested in pursuing a data art / visualisation project. From there came the idea of visualising Spotify top tracks as butterflies!

Sadly, Spotify doesn't allow third-party apps to start with "Spot" or sound / look like "Spotify", so I had to go for a different name that doesn't sound like a portmanteau of "Spotify" and "butterfly". Stuck with the concept, though :)
